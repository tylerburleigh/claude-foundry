# Review Types

## 1. Phase Review
**Scope:** Single phase within specification (typically 3-10 tasks)
**When to use:** Phase completion checkpoints, before moving to next phase
**Output:** Phase-specific fidelity report with per-task breakdown
**Best practice:** Use at phase boundaries to catch drift before starting next phase

## 2. Task Review
**Scope:** Individual task implementation (typically 1 file)
**When to use:** Critical task validation, complex implementation verification
**Output:** Task-specific compliance check with implementation comparison
**Best practice:** Use for high-risk tasks (auth, data handling, API contracts)

**Note:** For full spec reviews, run phase-by-phase reviews for better manageability and quality.
