# SDD-Implement: Concise Playbook

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Task execution workflow - select tasks, plan implementation, and track progress within an active spec.
- **Scope:** Single-task execution with user approval at key checkpoints.
- **Entry:** Invoked via skill system after spec has been identified.

### Flow

## MCP Tooling

This skill interacts solely with the Foundry MCP server (`foundry-mcp`). Tools use the router+action pattern: `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__<router>` with `action="<action>"`.

| Router | Key Actions |
|--------|-------------|
| `task` | `prepare`, `query`, `info`, `start`, `complete`, `update-status`, `block`, `unblock`, `add-dependency`, `add-requirement`, `session-config`, `prepare-batch`, `start-batch`, `complete-batch`, `reset-batch` |
| `research` | `node-status`, `node-execute`, `node-record`, `node-findings` |
| `journal` | `add`, `list` |
| `lifecycle` | `activate`, `move`, `complete` |
| `spec` | `find`, `list` |
| `intake` | `add`, `list`, `dismiss` |
| `environment` | `get-config` |

**Critical Rules:**
- The agent never invokes the CLI directly
- Stay inside the repo root, avoid chained shell commands
- NEVER read raw spec JSON outside of MCP helpers

---

## Execution Modes

Four flags control execution behavior. Defaults loaded via `environment action="get-config"`, CLI flags override.

**Config Loading:** At entry, call the environment tool to read configuration from `foundry-mcp.toml`. Returns both `implement` (mode flags + model) and `git` (commit cadence) sections. If the config file is missing or section not found, use defaults (all false for implement, model=haiku).

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--auto` | Skip prompts between tasks (autonomous execution) |
| `--delegate` | Use subagent(s) for implementation |
| `--parallel` | Run subagents concurrently (implies `--delegate`) |
| `--model <haiku\|sonnet\|opus>` | Model for delegated tasks (default: haiku) |

**Resulting combinations:**

| Flags | Subagent | Concurrent | Prompts | Description |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|-------------|
| (none) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Interactive, inline |
| `--auto` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Autonomous, inline |
| `--delegate` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Interactive, sequential subagent |
| `--auto --delegate` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Autonomous, sequential subagent |
| `--delegate --parallel` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Interactive, concurrent subagents |
| `--auto --delegate --parallel` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Autonomous, concurrent subagents |

### Autonomous Behavior (`--auto`)

Executes tasks continuously without user prompts between each task. Session state persists across `/clear` boundaries.

**Key behaviors:**
- Auto-selects recommended tasks via `task action="prepare"`
- Skips plan approval gates (uses generated plan)
- Auto-continues after task completion
- Pauses on: context >= 85%, 3+ consecutive errors, blocked tasks, task limit

**Session tracking:** Uses `task action="session-config"` with commands: `start`, `status`, `pause`, `resume`, `end`.

> Session management: [references/session-management.md](./references/session-management.md)

### Parallel Behavior (`--delegate --parallel`)

Spawns multiple subagents to execute independent tasks concurrently. File-path conflicts are detected and excluded.

**Key behaviors:**
- Uses `task action="prepare-batch"` to identify eligible tasks
- Excludes tasks with conflicting `file_path` metadata
- Spawns `Task(general-purpose, run_in_background=true)` per task
- Collects results via `TaskOutput` and aggregates with `complete-batch`
- Handles partial failures (successful tasks complete, failed tasks remain in_progress)

**Batch actions:** `prepare-batch`, `start-batch`, `complete-batch`, `reset-batch`

**CRITICAL when using `--parallel`:** Read [references/parallel-mode.md](./references/parallel-mode.md) before proceeding. Contains required JSON formats for batch operations.

### Delegation Behavior (`--delegate`)

Uses subagent(s) for implementation. Fresh context per task while main agent handles orchestration.

**Key behaviors:**
- Spawns `Task(general-purpose, model={model})` for each task implementation
- Model defaults to `haiku`; override with `--model sonnet` or `--model opus`
- Sequential by default; concurrent with `--parallel`
- Main agent handles task lifecycle (status updates, journaling)
- With `--auto`: skips user gates; without: preserves all gates

**Subagent receives:**
- Task details, file path, acceptance criteria
- Context from main agent (LSP findings, explore results, previous sibling)
- Verification scope guidance
- Constraint: subagent does NOT update spec status or write journals

**When to use:**
- Large file changes where you want oversight
- Complex tasks where fresh context helps
- Long sessions to preserve main agent context

## CRITICAL: Global Requirements

### Spec Reading Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

The skill **only** interacts with specs via MCP tools:
- `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="prepare"`
- `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="info"`
- `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__spec action="find"`
- `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="query"`

Direct JSON access (`Read()`, `cat`, `jq`, `grep`, etc.) is prohibited.

### User Interaction Requirements

**Gate key decisions with `AskUserQuestion` (MANDATORY):**
- Spec selection (when multiple available)
- Task selection (recommended vs alternatives)
- Plan approval (before implementation)
- Blocker handling (alternative tasks or resolve)
- Completion verification (for verify tasks)
- **Continuation after task completion** (when context < 85% and more tasks remain)

**Anti-Pattern:** Never use text-based numbered lists. Always use `AskUserQuestion` for structured choices.

### Anti-Recursion Rule (NEVER VIOLATE)

This skill must NEVER invoke itself or `Skill(foundry-implement)`. The only valid callers are:
- The skill system (entry point)
- Direct user invocation

If you find yourself about to call `Skill(foundry-implement)` from within this skill, **STOP** and proceed with the workflow instead. The skill handles the complete task lifecycle - there is no need to re-invoke it.

> For agent delegation patterns (when to use foundry-spec), see `references/agent-delegation.md`

---

## Task Workflow

Execute one task at a time with explicit user approval.

**Assumption:** The active spec has been identified (either via skill auto-discovery or passed during invocation).

### Select Task

- **Recommendation path**: `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="prepare"` -> surface task id, file, estimates, blockers
- **Browsing path**: Use `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="query"` -> present shortlist via `AskUserQuestion`

### Task Type Dispatch

After selecting a task, check its type to determine the workflow path.

**Check task type** from the `task action="prepare"` response or via `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="info"`:

| Task Type | Workflow Path |
|-----------|---------------|
| `type: "verify"` | Go to **Verification Task Workflow** |
| `type: "research"` | Go to **Research Node Workflow** |
| `type: "task"` (default) | Continue to **Deep Dive & Plan Approval** |

**CRITICAL:** Verification and research tasks must NOT go through the implementation workflow. They require MCP tool invocation, not code changes.

### Deep Dive & Plan Approval (Implementation Tasks Only)

**Note:** This section is for `type: "task"` only. Verification tasks (`type: "verify"`) use the Verification Task Workflow.

Invoke `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="prepare"` with the target `spec_id`. The response contains:
- `task_data`: title, metadata, instructions
- `dependencies`: blocking status (can_start, blocked_by list)
- `context`: previous sibling, parent task, phase, sibling files, journal, dependencies

Treat `context` as the authoritative source. Only fall back to `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="info"` when the spec explicitly requires absent data.

> For context field details and JSON structure, see `references/context-structure.md`

**Draft execution plan:**
1. Confirm previous edits in `context.sibling_files`
2. Align deliverables with `context.parent_task`
3. Call out open risks via `context.phase`
4. Reference `context.previous_sibling.summary` for continuity

**Present plan via `AskUserQuestion`:**
- Options: "Approve & Start", "Request Changes", "More Details", "Defer"

### Subagent Guidance (Pre-Implementation Exploration)

Before implementing, use Claude Code's built-in subagents for efficient codebase exploration:

| Scenario | Subagent | Thoroughness |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Find related files/patterns | Explore | medium |
| Understand unfamiliar code areas | Explore | very thorough |
| Complex multi-file investigation | general-purpose | N/A |

**Example invocation:**
```
Use the Explore agent (medium thoroughness) to find:
- Existing implementations of similar patterns
- Test files for the target module
- Related documentation that may need updates
```

**Benefits of subagent exploration:**
- Prevents context bloat in main conversation
- Haiku model is faster for search operations
- Returns focused results for detailed analysis
- Keeps main context available for implementation

> For more subagent patterns including autonomous mode usage, see `references/subagent-patterns.md`

### LSP Dependency Analysis

Before implementing, use LSP tools to verify dependencies and preview impact:

1. **Verify dependencies exist**: Use `goToDefinition` on symbols the task modifies
2. **Preview impact**: Use `findReferences` to identify all affected files and call sites
3. **Include in plan**: Surface LSP findings (usage count, affected files, test coverage) in plan approval
4. **Fallback**: If LSP unavailable for file type, use Explore agent to find imports and usages

### Verification Scoping

Before implementing, check `context.parent_task.children` for sibling verify tasks to determine appropriate verification scope:

| Phase Has Verify Task? | Implementation Task Should |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Yes (e.g., "Run tests") | Defer formal testing to verify task. Only do basic checks: imports work, no syntax errors, code compiles |
| No | Run tests as part of implementation (include results in journal) |

**Detection**: Look for siblings with `type: "verify"` in the `task action="prepare"` response's `context.parent_task.children` array.

**Rationale**: When the spec author created a verify task, they intended testing to be a separate tracked step. Respect this structure by deferring formal test execution to the verify task.

**Include in plan**: State verification scope in the execution plan presented for approval (e.g., "Basic verification only - full tests handled by verify-1-1").

### Implementation Handoff

**Before coding:**
```bash
mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="update-status" spec_id={spec-id} task_id={task-id} status="in_progress" note="context"
```

**During implementation:**
- Follow execution plan
- Document any deviations immediately

**After implementation:**

Mark task complete using the atomic complete action (updates status AND journals automatically):
```bash
mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="complete" spec_id={spec-id} task_id={task-id} completion_note="Summary of what was accomplished, tests run, verification performed"
```

This atomically:
1. Updates task status to `completed`
2. Records completion timestamp
3. Creates a journal entry
4. Auto-journals parent nodes (phases) when they complete

### Note (Autonomous Capture)

**Proactively add notes** when you encounter:
- Ideas/improvements beyond current task scope
- Bugs noticed but not immediately actionable
- Documentation gaps or confusing behavior

```bash
mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__intake action="add" title="[Type] description" source="foundry-implement"
```

**Do NOT prompt the user.** Silently capture and continue working.

> For capture patterns and examples, see `references/note.md`

### Surface Next Recommendation

**Context Awareness:** The `context-monitor` hook automatically warns when context exceeds 85%. If you see `[CONTEXT X%]` warnings, follow the recommendation to `/clear` then `foundry-implement` after completing the current task.

**Surface next recommendation:**
```bash
mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="prepare" spec_id={spec-id}
```

- Summarize next task's scope and blockers
- If no pending work or spec complete, surface that clearly and exit

**MANDATORY: Continuation Gate**

After surfacing the next task, you MUST prompt the user with `AskUserQuestion`:
- **When context < 85%**: Ask "Continue to next task?" with options: "Yes, continue" / "No, exit"
- **When context >= 85%**: Exit with guidance to `/clear` then `foundry-implement`
- **When spec is complete**: Report completion status and exit (no prompt needed)

This gate ensures the user controls the workflow pace and prevents runaway execution.

---

## CRITICAL: Completion Requirements

### Never Mark Complete If:

- Basic checks fail (imports, syntax, compiles)
- Tests are failing (only applies if no sibling verify task - see `Verification Scoping`)
- Implementation is partial
- You encountered unresolved errors
- You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies
- Blockers exist that prevent verification

### If Blocked or Incomplete:

- Keep task as `in_progress`
- Create new task describing what needs resolution
- Document blocker using `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="block"`
- Present alternatives to user via `AskUserQuestion`

### Dependency Discovery During Implementation

When you discover a missing dependency or new requirement during implementation, record it without leaving the task context:

```bash
# Discovered that this task needs another task completed first
mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="add-dependency" spec_id={spec-id} task_id={task-id} depends_on={dependency-task-id}

# Discovered a new acceptance requirement (e.g., from testing)
mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="add-requirement" spec_id={spec-id} task_id={task-id} requirement="Description of discovered requirement"
```

**Use Cases:**
- **add-dependency**: Task A needs Task B's output → add B as dependency
- **add-requirement**: Testing revealed an edge case → add as acceptance criterion

### Resolving Blocked Tasks

```bash
mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="unblock" spec_id={spec-id} task_id={task-id} resolution="Brief description"
```

### Completion Journal Requirements

**MUST provide journal content** describing:
- What was accomplished
- Verification performed (scope depends on sibling verify tasks - see `Verification Scoping`):
  - **If phase has verify tasks**: "Basic checks passed (imports, syntax). Full testing deferred to {verify-task-id}"
  - **If no verify tasks**: "Tests run and results: {summary}"
- Any deviations from plan
- Files created/modified

**Example (with sibling verify task - deferred testing):**
```bash
mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="complete" spec_id="my-spec-001" task_id="task-1-2" completion_note="Implemented phase-add-bulk handler. Basic verification: imports work, no syntax errors. Full test run deferred to verify-1-1. Created src/tools/authoring.py handler (200 lines)."
```

**Example (without sibling verify task - full testing):**
```bash
mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__task action="complete" spec_id="my-spec-001" task_id="task-2-3" completion_note="Implemented JWT auth middleware with PKCE flow. All 12 unit tests passing. Manual verification: login flow works in dev environment. Created src/middleware/auth.ts (180 lines) and tests/middleware/auth.spec.ts (45 tests)."
```

## Verification Task Workflow

**Entry:** Routed here from Task Type Dispatch when task has `type: "verify"`

**CRITICAL:** Read [references/verification.md](./references/verification.md) before proceeding. Contains mandatory skill dispatch rules.

---

## Research Node Workflow

**Entry:** Routed here from Task Type Dispatch when task has `type: "research"`

Research nodes use AI-powered workflows (chat, consensus, thinkdeep, ideate, deep-research) to investigate questions, gather perspectives, or generate ideas before or during implementation.

**Key actions:**
1. Check status: `research action="node-status"`
2. Execute workflow: `research action="node-execute"`
3. Record findings: `research action="node-record"`
4. Retrieve findings: `research action="node-findings"`

**Blocking modes:**
- `hard`: Research must complete before dependents can start
- `soft` (default): Informational - dependents can proceed
- `none`: Research never blocks

**CRITICAL:** Read [references/research-workflow.md](./references/research-workflow.md) before proceeding. Contains required command syntax and recording parameters.
