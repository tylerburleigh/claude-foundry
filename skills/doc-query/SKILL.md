# doc-query: Codebase Documentation Query System

## Overview

`Skill(foundry:doc-query)` builds structured context from the codebase documentation artifacts. Instead of parsing source files directly, the skill queries the generated JSON corpus (`codebase.json`) plus the sharded Markdown set under `docs/` to answer questions about classes, functions, dependencies, call graphs, and refactoring candidates. Every operation flows through the Foundry MCP server using the `code` router.

**Core capabilities**
- Entity lookup for classes, functions, and modules
- Incoming/outgoing call analysis with depth controls
- Blast-radius and dependency impact assessments
- Complexity and refactoring heuristics
- Feature- and data-oriented exploration workflows (scope, trace-entry, trace-data, impact, refactor)
- Automatic documentation staleness detection and refresh

Use the skill whenever you need a fast, structured understanding of an unfamiliar feature, want to estimate the impact of a change, or need to surface complexity/risk hot spots before touching code.

## MCP Tooling

Doc-query calls the `code` router with various actions (using the pattern `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__code action="<action>"`):

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `find-class` | Locate class definitions by exact or fuzzy name |
| `find-function` | Locate function definitions and metadata |
| `get-callers` | List functions that call a given function |
| `get-callees` | List functions invoked by a given function |
| `trace-calls` | Build configurable call graphs (upstream/downstream/both) |
| `impact-analysis` | Perform dependency-based blast-radius assessments |
| `doc-stats` | Inspect documentation freshness, entity counts, and complexity metrics |

Higher-level workflows (scope, trace-entry, trace-data, refactor-candidates, etc.) orchestrate combinations of these base tools; you do **not** need to invoke them directly—simply describe the workflow you want when calling the skill and it issues the necessary MCP requests.

## Quick Start

1. **Confirm documentation exists** – run `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__code action="doc-stats"`. If the response warns about missing data, generate docs first.
2. **Scope your module** – instruct the skill with something like `"scope module=src/auth/login.py mode=plan"`. The skill gathers summaries, dependencies, and complexity stats by chaining `code action="find-*"`, `code action="trace-calls"`, and `code action="impact-analysis"`.
3. **Explore execution or data flow** – use the skill's `trace-entry` or `trace-data` workflows (e.g., `"trace entry function=process_request depth=3"`). The skill builds a call tree via `code action="trace-calls"` plus targeted caller/callee lookups.
4. **Estimate risk** – ask for `impact entity=UserService depth=2`. Behind the scenes the skill runs `code action="impact-analysis"`, call graph expansion, and dependency checks.
5. **Dive deeper manually** – if you need raw lookups, request them explicitly ("find function calculate_score" → `code action="find-function"`, "callers calculate_score" → `code action="get-callers"`, etc.).

## When to Use

✅ **Use doc-query to:**
- Gather context before implementing or refactoring a feature
- Locate relevant code quickly during bug triage
- Understand how data moves through the system
- Prioritize refactoring work based on complexity and usage
- Estimate the blast radius of an upcoming change
- Build call graphs or documentation excerpts for design reviews

❌ **Avoid doc-query when:**
- Documentation has never been generated (generate docs first)
- You must inspect raw source code (use `Read`/`Explore` tools)
- You require runtime behavior or profiler data (use debugging tools instead)

## Documentation Requirements & Auto-Refresh

- The skill expects `codebase.json` plus the sharded Markdown docs under `docs/`.
- On every query, doc-query compares the documentation timestamp with the latest source commit. If stale, it transparently triggers a regeneration (unless you explicitly disable refresh in your instructions).
- Use these flags in your prompt when needed:
  - `skip_refresh=true` – still checks staleness but only warns
  - `no_staleness_check=true` – bypasses the check entirely for maximum speed

## Automated Workflows

The skill exposes several named workflows. Simply describe the workflow you want; no CLI syntax is required.

### Scope
Produces a tailored briefing for a module or feature area (planning vs implementation views). Internally calls `code-find-*`, `doc-stats`, and targeted dependency queries.

```
Skill(foundry:doc-query) "scope module=src/auth/login.py mode=implement"
```

### Trace Entry
Builds an end-to-end call chain from an entry function or endpoint, highlighting architectural layers and complexity hot spots (`code-trace-calls` + `code-get-callers/callees`).

### Trace Data
Follows a class or DTO across its lifecycle (create/read/update/delete touch points) using entity lookups and call graphs.

### Impact
Estimates blast radius and risk before modifying a function, class, or module. Combines `code-impact-analysis`, dependency traversal, and caller insight.

### Refactor Candidates
Ranks high-complexity, high-dependency targets for refactoring by querying complexity stats plus usage counts.

## Manual Query Reference

When you need granular control, ask the skill to invoke the specific MCP actions:

| Goal | Instruction Example | Underlying Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Find a class | `"find class WizardSession"` | `code action="find-class"` |
| Find a function | `"find function calculate_score"` | `code action="find-function"` |
| Describe callers | `"callers calculate_score"` | `code action="get-callers"` |
| Describe callees | `"callees process_request"` | `code action="get-callees"` |
| Build a call graph | `"trace calls process_request direction=down depth=3"` | `code action="trace-calls"` |
| Impact analysis | `"impact entity=UserService depth=2"` | `code action="impact-analysis"` |
| Documentation stats | `"doc stats"` | `code action="doc-stats"` |

The skill supports pagination for find/class/function queries; specify `limit` or ask for "next page" and it will pass the cursor returned by the tool.

## Tool Verification

Before running complex workflows:
1. Call `mcp__plugin_foundry_foundry-mcp__code action="doc-stats"` to ensure documentation is loaded (the response includes the detected docs path and freshness timestamp).
2. If stats fail with "Documentation not loaded", regenerate documentation first.
3. Optionally, request `code action="doc-stats"` again to confirm freshness.

## Examples

### Trace Execution Flow
```
Skill(foundry:doc-query) "trace entry function=run_scoring depth=3"
```
Returns the layered call graph (endpoint → service → repository), complexity scores, and a hotspot summary.

### Impact Assessment
```
Skill(foundry:doc-query) "impact entity=get_session depth=2"
```
Provides direct/indirect dependents, test coverage hints, and risk scoring so you know how risky the change is.

### Refactor Planning
```
Skill(foundry:doc-query) "refactor candidates min_complexity=15 limit=10"
```
Returns a prioritized list of high-value refactors with quick-win vs major-effort tags.
