description: AI-powered research skill with five workflows - chat (single-model conversation), consensus (multi-model synthesis), thinkdeep (systematic investigation), ideate (creative brainstorming), and deep (multi-phase web research). Supports persistent threads and research sessions.

# Research Skill

## Overview

- **Purpose:** AI-powered research with multiple reasoning strategies
- **Scope:** Five workflows, persistent thread and session management
- **Entry:** `/research` command or `Skill(foundry:research)`

### Flow

> `[x?]`=decision `(GATE)`=user approval `→`=sequence

```
- **Entry** → [explicit?] → Dispatch | [thread-id?] → Resume
  | [research-id?] → SessionMgmt | [sessions?] → ListSessions
  | [no args?] → (GATE) | AutoRoute
- **Dispatch** → Execute → PersistThread → Response + thread_id
- **Deep** → Start → Poll → Report (background execution)
```

## MCP Tooling

| Router | Actions |
|--------|---------|
| `research` | `chat`, `consensus`, `thinkdeep`, `ideate`, `deep-research`, `deep-research-status`, `deep-research-report`, `deep-research-list`, `deep-research-delete`, `thread-list`, `thread-get`, `thread-delete` |

## MCP Contract

| Action | Required | Optional | Errors |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| `chat` | `prompt` | `thread_id`, `model` | `THREAD_NOT_FOUND` |
| `consensus` | `prompt` | `models[]`, `strategy` | `NO_MODELS_AVAILABLE` |
| `thinkdeep` | `prompt` | `thread_id`, `depth` | `MAX_DEPTH_EXCEEDED` |
| `ideate` | `prompt` | `thread_id`, `phase` | `INVALID_PHASE` |
| `deep-research` | `query` | `max_iterations`, `max_sub_queries`, `follow_links` | `RESEARCH_TIMEOUT` |
| `deep-research-status` | `research_id` | - | `RESEARCH_NOT_FOUND` |
| `deep-research-report` | `research_id` | - | `RESEARCH_NOT_FOUND` |
| `deep-research-list` | - | `limit`, `completed_only` | - |
| `deep-research-delete` | `research_id` | - | `RESEARCH_NOT_FOUND` |
| `thread-*` | `thread_id` | `limit` | `THREAD_NOT_FOUND` |

## Workflow Selection

| Signal | Workflow |
|--------|----------|
| Follow-up, iteration | `chat` |
| Multiple perspectives | `consensus` |
| Complex problem | `thinkdeep` |
| Brainstorming | `ideate` |
| Comprehensive research, multiple sources | `deep` |

## User Gates

- No args: workflow selection
- Ambiguous: clarify before auto-route
- Consensus: strategy selection
- Ideate: phase transition
- Deep: progress updates during background execution

## Output Formats

| Workflow | Response |
|----------|----------|
| `chat` | `{response, thread_id, model}` |
| `consensus` | `{responses[], synthesis, strategy}` |
| `thinkdeep` | `{findings[], confidence, thread_id}` |
| `ideate` | `{ideas[], phase, selected[]}` |
| `deep` | `{research_id, status, report{summary, findings[], sources[]}}` |
