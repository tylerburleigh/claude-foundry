# Claude Foundry - Spec-Driven Development for Claude Code

Plan before you code. Verify against the spec. Ship with confidence.

## Overview

Ad-hoc coding with AI assistants often leads to unclear requirements, untracked progress, and implementation drift. Claude Foundry brings structure to AI-assisted development through **spec-driven development (SDD)**: you create a detailed specification first, then implement against it with granular task tracking and AI-powered verification.

**Who it's for:** Developers using Claude Code who want traceable, auditable AI-assisted development with clear requirements and verifiable outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Spec-Driven Methodology** - Plan before code with mandatory human approval gates. Specs define requirements, phases, tasks, and verification steps.
- **Fidelity Verification** - AI compares implementation to spec requirements. Catches drift between what was planned and what was built.
- **Task Dependencies & Tracking** - Granular task states with automatic next-task recommendations. Know what's done, blocked, or ready.
- **Auditable Decision Journals** - Every task completion logs decisions made. Full traceability of why changes happened.
- **Context Flow to PRs** - PR descriptions generated from spec + journals + git history. Reviewers understand the "why", not just the "what".
- **Multi-Model Research** - Query multiple AI models for consensus, deep research, or structured ideation before planning.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Python | 3.10+ | Required for foundry-mcp server |
| Claude Code | Latest | The CLI tool from Anthropic |
| foundry-mcp | Latest | MCP server (installed via pip) |

## Installation

### 1. Install foundry-mcp

```bash
pip install foundry-mcp
```

Or with pipx for isolated installation:

```bash
pipx install foundry-mcp
```

Verify installation:

```bash
python -m foundry_mcp.server --help
```

### 2. Install the plugin

From within Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add tylerburleigh/claude-foundry
/plugin install foundry@claude-foundry
```

Restart Claude Code and trust the repository when prompted.

> **Note:** The MCP server is automatically registered when you install the plugin. Do not manually add it with `claude mcp add`.

## Quick Start

1. **Run setup** - Ask Claude to configure permissions and verify installation:
   ```
   Please run foundry-setup to configure the workspace.
   ```

2. **Research** (optional) - Ask Claude to explore the codebase or research best practices:
   ```
   Research how authentication is currently handled in this codebase.
   Do deep research on current best practices for JWT refresh tokens.
   ```

3. **Describe what you want** - Tell Claude what you want to build:
   ```
   I want to add user authentication with JWT tokens.
   ```
   Claude creates a spec with phases, tasks, and verification steps.

4. **Implement** - Ask Claude to work through tasks (verification is built into the spec):
   ```
   Let's implement the next task from the spec.
   ```

5. **Ship** - Create a PR when the spec is complete:
   ```
   Create a pull request for this completed spec.
   ```

## Example Workflow

A complete spec-driven development cycle:

```bash
# 1. Research (optional): Understand existing patterns
"Research how the current API handles errors"
# Single-model chat, multi-model consensus, or deep web research

# 2. Describe your feature: Claude creates the spec
"I want to add rate limiting to the API endpoints"
# Claude invokes foundry-spec, asks clarifying questions, creates spec
# Spec saved to specs/pending/, then activated after your approval

# 3. Implement: Work through tasks
"Let's implement the next task"
# Shows next task, you implement it, verification tasks auto-dispatch
# When foundry-implement hits a verify task, it runs foundry-review or tests

# 4. Ship: Create PR when spec is complete
"Create a PR for this spec"
# Generates PR from spec metadata, journals, and git history
```

## How It Works

```
research → describe intent → implement → (auto-verify) → create PR
    │             │               │              │             │
    ▼             ▼               ▼              ▼             ▼
 Explore      Claude          Work on       Verify tasks    Create PR
 codebase     creates         tasks via     auto-dispatch   with full
 or web       spec            dependency    to review       context
                              order         or tests
```

| Step | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Research** | Optional first step to explore the codebase or research best practices via web search. |
| **Describe intent** | Tell Claude what you want to build. Claude creates a spec with phases, tasks, and verification steps. |
| **Implement** | Ask Claude to implement - it finds next task by dependency order. You implement, it tracks progress. |
| **Auto-verify** | Specs include verify tasks. When implementation hits one, it auto-dispatches to `foundry-review` or `foundry-test`. |
| **Ship** | Ask to create PR - generates from spec metadata, journals, and commit history. |

### Skill Architecture

Under the hood, these skills power the workflow:

```
foundry-research → foundry-spec → foundry-implement → [CODE] → foundry-review → foundry-test → foundry-pr

        ▼              ▼                ▼               ▼            ▼               ▼              ▼
     Explore        Create          Find next        Write        Verify         Validate       Generate
     codebase        spec            task            code         against          with          PR with
     or web                          and                          spec           tests         context
                                    track
```

## Skills Reference

Skills are invoked by Claude based on your intent. Describe what you want, and Claude selects the appropriate skill.

| Skill | When Claude uses it |
|-------|---------------------|
| `foundry-spec` | You describe a feature or ask to plan something |
| `foundry-implement` | You ask to work on tasks or implement features |
| `foundry-review` | Verify task in spec, or you ask to check implementation |
| `foundry-test` | Verify task in spec, or you ask to run/debug tests |
| `foundry-pr` | You ask to create a pull request |
| `foundry-refactor` | You ask to rename, extract, or move code |
| `foundry-research` | You ask to research or investigate something |
| `foundry-note` | You ask to capture an idea or track an issue |
| `foundry-setup` | First-time setup and permissions configuration |

## Configuration

The plugin stores configuration in `foundry-mcp.toml`. Key settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `workspace` | Current directory | Working directory for specs |
| `specs_dir` | `specs/` | Where specs are stored |
| `providers` | System default | AI providers for research workflows |

Specs are organized by status:

```
specs/
├── pending/    # Specs in planning phase
├── active/     # Specs being implemented
└── completed/  # Finished specs (archived)
```

## Scope and Limitations

**Best for:**
- Feature development with clear requirements
- Bug fixes that benefit from structured investigation
- Multi-phase projects where progress tracking matters
- Work that needs auditable history (journals, specs)

**Not for:**
- One-line fixes or trivial changes
- Exploratory prototyping without clear goals
- Tasks where overhead exceeds benefit
