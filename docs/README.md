# Claude Foundry Documentation

Welcome to Claude Foundry, a Claude Code plugin for **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**.

Instead of diving straight into code, SDD helps you plan first, implement systematically, and verify your work matches your intentions. Claude Foundry automates this workflow with AI-powered planning, progress tracking, and quality verification.
