# Superpowers: Complete Software Development Workflow

## Overview

Superpowers is a system of composable skills designed to guide coding agents through structured development. Rather than immediately writing code, it emphasizes understanding requirements first: "it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do."

## Core Workflow Philosophy

The system operates through several mandatory phases:

1. **Design refinement** - Interactive brainstorming that explores alternatives and presents specifications in digestible sections
2. **Planning** - Breaking work into 2-5 minute tasks with exact file paths and verification steps
3. **Implementation** - Subagent-driven development with two-stage review (specification compliance, then code quality)
4. **Quality assurance** - Test-driven development enforcing the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle

## Key Principles

The framework emphasizes "systematic over ad-hoc" approaches, prioritizing simplicity and evidence-based verification. It enforces true test-driven development where "write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit."

## Installation & Availability

For Claude Code users, installation occurs via the plugin marketplace. Codex and OpenCode require manual setup through separate installation documents. The system supports automatic skill updates through plugin management.

## Support & Community

The project welcomes contributions following established skill-writing guidelines. Users can report issues, access the marketplace, and review detailed documentation for platform-specific implementations.
