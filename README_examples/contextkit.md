# ContextKit README Summary

**ContextKit** is a CLI framework for Claude Code that transforms AI-assisted development from reactive task execution into systematic, proactive feature building. Created by indie developer Cihat Gunduz, it addresses fundamental challenges in AI-driven coding workflows.

## Core Problem It Solves

The framework tackles a critical inefficiency: developers typically manage AI assistants step-by-step rather than collaborating with them strategically. As the documentation states, users spend time "figuring out what to ask for next" instead of leveraging AI's full potential.

## Key Features

**Four-Phase Methodology:**
1. Business Case specification (requirements without technical details)
2. Technical Architecture planning (technology choices and patterns)
3. Implementation Tasks (file-by-file breakdown with S001-S999 numbering)
4. Development execution (supervised autonomy with quality agents)

**Specialized Quality Agents** handle accessibility checks, localization validation, modern code patterns, and artifact cleanup automatically during development.

**Two Workflow Options:**
- Full systematic workflow for major features requiring detailed planning
- Quick workflow for bug fixes and smaller improvements

## Technical Highlights

- Auto-detects project type (React, Swift, Kotlin, Python, etc.)
- Preserves context between sessions through structured documentation
- Maintains user customizations while auto-updating core templates
- Provides real-time token usage monitoring with visual progress bars
- Includes platform-specific guidelines (Swift/SwiftUI currently available)

## Backstory

The tool emerged from hundreds of hours developing iOS apps with AI assistance. The creator systematically identified failures and built executable workflows addressing recurring pain points around planning intelligence, context preservation, and quality enforcement.

ContextKit remains actively evolving, with community contributions welcome for platform guidelines and formatter configurations.
