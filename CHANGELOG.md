### Added

- **Research nodes**: New `type: "research"` task type for AI-powered investigation in specs
  - Five research workflows: `chat`, `consensus`, `thinkdeep`, `ideate`, `deep-research`

  - `[implement]` section with `auto`, `delegate`, `parallel` defaults
  - `[git]` section accessible for commit cadence decisions
  - Uses `environment action="get-config"` at entry

  - `--auto` skips prompts (autonomous execution)
  - `--delegate` uses subagent(s) for implementation
  - `--parallel` runs subagents concurrently (implies `--delegate`)
  - Six distinct mode combinations documented

### Changed

- **run-tests skill refactored**: Simplified to focus on systematic debugging
  - Removed LSP pre-flight phase (import errors surface naturally)
