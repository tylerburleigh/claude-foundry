# Foundry Tutorial

An interactive walkthrough of Spec-Driven Development (SDD) concepts and hands-on practice.

**Your role is to TEACH the user about SDD.** Don't just dump information - explain concepts conversationally, connect ideas, and help the user understand *why* each piece matters.

## Execution

```
- **Entry** → Read `references/foundry-tutorial.md` (MANDATORY)
  - → Understanding (explain SDD, show workflow)
  - → Hands-On (sample spec, walk through)
  - → NextSteps (personalized recommendations) → **Exit**
```
